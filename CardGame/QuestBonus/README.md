# Bonus PyQuest Cards

The cards here are neither yet part of the [PyQuest Core](https://github.com/Python3-Training/PyQuest/tree/main/CardGame/QuestCore), nor the [Pyquest Projects](https://github.com/Python3-Training/PyQuest/tree/main/CardGame/QuestProjects) Decks. 

## Video Quests
Cards prefixed by "KV" are part of an ongoing video quest.

For example, a good many bonus cards come from my copyrighted [Apress video on Python networking](https://link.springer.com/video/10.1007/978-1-4842-9454-3).

## Concept Quests
Cards prefixed by "K0" herein are mostly part of an ongoing quest to demonstrate selected concepts (etc.)
