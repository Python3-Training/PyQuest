# PyQuest Practice Projects

One great way to practice becomming proficient in Python, here are some practice PROJECTS for you to enjoy!

Part of a long-term game play, feel free to assign higher point values for an in-class - and / or weekly - competition. 

Also yes, a book - complete with code - is presently in the works. In the mean time, I am sharing the solutions to these projects with our [PyQuest group](https://www.facebook.com/PythonVideo) on Facebook.

Feel free to encourage us in this effort by [ordering the basic set of cards online](https://www.amazon.com/100-PyQuest-Cards-Randall-Nagy/dp/B0BZF8VHDJ/).

Finally, if you are short on cash - or event if you're not ;-) - another free way to support this happy task would be to [join the PyQuest team on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/PythonVideo). 

Please note that I also share much of my 'Pythoneering activities in the [Python Training Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/nagyspythontraining) as well.

Clearly then... I am indeed looking forward to seeing you in the professional software development world?


Happy 'Pythoneering,
