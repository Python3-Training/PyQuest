# PyQuest Practice Projects

One great way to practice becomming proficient in Python, here are some practice PROJECTS for you to enjoy!

Part of a long-term game play, feel free to assign higher point values for an in-class - and / or weekly - competition. 

Also yes, a book - complete with code - is on the 'Zon.

Feel free to encourage us in this effort by [ordering the basic set of cards](https://www.amazon.com/100-PyQuest-Cards-Randall-Nagy/dp/B0BZF8VHDJ/) and the [core set of concepts](https://www.amazon.com/100-Python-Questions-Concepts-Interview/dp/B0BH97W78F) online.

(Come to that even if you like eggplant as much a I do then we've [got the garden egg covered](https://www.amazon.com/Randalls-Eggplant-Selections-Book-Recipe/dp/B09HVGB8ZF) as well (*))

## zConcept
Uniquely numbered, please feel free to share *_your_* solutions on *_your_* pages and / or posts. -Including the unique PyQuest card-number on *_your_* solutions helps other 'Pythoneers locate, lookup as well as appreciate *_your_* code, insights, and clever contributions across our 'Pythoneering planet!

Clearly then... I am indeed looking forward to seeing you in the professional software development world?


Happy 'Pythoneering,
