Howdie!

I can Grok that... 

Why?

Because with no particular insight aforethought, a handful of my fellow geeks & I decided to start collecting / sharing Python questions. 

The rest, as they say, is pure [serendipity](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/serendipity).

Because Python is in it's "magic" 3rd revision (much as I mention in [my amazon book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HJBD98J)) mentioned herein, again – and over the decades - I have discovered that it is that “golden third” which makes the continued evolution of ANY project worthy of our attention. -Certainly – in the case of Python 3 - ever more interesting to follow. 

So whilst we all continue to learn what is new & cool with Python – and as those PEPs trudge ever onward - my sincere hopes are - if nothing else - that following these Q’s and A’s will prove to be yet another great way for us all to keep up with a more responsible evolution of the Python Standard. 

Also - don't hate me because - like you - I too have bills to pay. For that reason alone, I do indeed plan on selling a much larger collection of this project, soon. (i.e: Daddy needs another laptop?)

Enjoy the journey,

Randall
